## 🎮 About the Game

**Taste of Fear** is an indie game that mixes **horror** and **time management**. Think about the crazy kitchen action from *Overcooked* mixed with the scary moments from *Five Nights at Freddy's*.

### 📖 The Story

Everything seems normal in a small town. Then suddenly, something goes very wrong. Regular restaurant customers turn into monsters. They want to eat really disgusting food. You are the chef stuck in this nightmare. You must cook what they want before time runs out.

**One mistake. One late order. One second too slow.**  
**That's when the terror begins.**

---

### 🎯 What Makes This Game Special

Every second counts as orders pile up and the clock moves toward midnight.

**🍳 Dynamic Kitchen**
