## 🎮 About the Project
An indie game that blends horror and time management genres. An experience that combines Overcooked’s kitchen chaos with the horror mechanics of Five Nights at Freddy’s.

**Concept:** In a small town where everything seems fine, something suddenly goes wrong and all customers turn into monsters. As the customers change, so do the dishes they demand, becoming truly disgusting.
